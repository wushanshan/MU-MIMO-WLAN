# MU-MIMO-WLAN

We provide Matlab codes for modeling and analyzing a CSMA/CA-based MAC protocol operating in a multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) wireless LAN (WLAN). They are supplementary materials to the following paper: [Performance Study on a CSMA/CA-Based MAC
Protocol for Multi-User MIMO Wireless LANs][MU-MIMO]. The MAC protocoal simulation is provided in the `*_main.m` function while the analytical modeling is given in the `*_model_main.m` function.
